    <!--- BEGIN: The World Wide Web --->
    <h3> WWW: "The World Wide Web" </h3>
    <p>The "web" is composed of several key components. The first is what you see as the user. You're using a computer. This computer has a "web browser" - the software you use to access the internet experience. If you're old enough, you might remember "Netscape"
      which was esseentially the first modern web browser. We now use Apple's Safari, Google's Chrome, and many others to access the internet. </p>
    <p>The next component is the "internet" itself. The internet is composed of computers called servers. These servers are usually in a nondescript building, stacked in "racks", and maintained by some really smart computer IT technicians. These computers
      "host" the HTML web pages that we access every time we use browse the internet. <b>The key take away is that the web is a collection of web pages </b></p>
  </div>
  <!--- END: The World Wide Web --->

  <div>
    <!--- BEGIN: Hypertext Markup Language--->
    <h3> HTML: "Hypertext Markup Language"</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li> Text - Basically, refers to the data that you see in your web browser</li>
        <li> Markup - Arrangement of the content</li>
        <li> Hyperlinks - "Links" your current page to other pages and information sources.</li>
    </p>

    <p>HTML is made up of <b>"tags"</b>. These tags are used to form <b>"elements"</b>. Elements are used to infuence the behavior, look, and feel of web pages.</p>
    <p>For example, a generic element might look liks this:
      <br>
      <br><b> &lttag&gt contents &lt/tag&gt </b>
      <br>
      <br> The &lttag&gt is the "opening tag"
      <br> The &lt/tag&gt is the "closing tag" So if you want to display the words "Run like the wind!" using bold letters, you can use the bold &ltb&gt tags to create an element like so
      <br>
      <br><b>
         &ltb&gtRun like the wind!&lt/b&gt </b>
      <br>
      <br> For the user, your HTML code will look like this: "<b>Run like the wind!</b>"
      <br>
      <br>

      <h5><b> Anchor Tag</b></h5> Another HTML tag is the "anchor tag" denoted by "a". The anchor tag allows you to create links to other pages or data sources on the web. The pseudocode for an anchor tag looks like this:
      <br>
      <br><b>
         &lta href = attribute &gt contents &lt/a&gt </b>
      <br>
      <br> In this example, the "href" stands for "hypertext reference".
      <br>
      <br> So let's say you wanted to create a hyperlink that would take you to <em>www.usatoday.com</em>. It would look something like the following.
      <br>
      <br><b>
         &lta href = www.usatoday.com &gt usatoday.com &lt/a&gt </b>
      <br>
      <br>

      <h5><b> Break Tag</b></h5> Not all elements use a closing tag. Tags that do not require a closing tag are called <b>void tags</b>. For example, the tag to create a line break or to push text to the next line on the page is called the "break" tag. The break tag is denoted
      by "br". So, all you would need to write in the HTML5 code is the following.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt br &gt </b>
      <br> One last point about "br". The break tag is considered "inline" versus "block". The difference between the two will be discussed later in this lesson.

      <h5><b> Image Tag</b></h5> The image "img" tag, only uses the opening tag plus a source attribute. This source reference is denoted by "src". The source is usually the location of the image file for its associated element. The element also needs to designate a value for
      the source. This is noted below by "url". Hence, an image element might look something like this
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt img src = url &gt or &lt img src = alt &gt</b>
      <br>
      <br> where the "alt" corresponds to some form of text. Remember, image elements do not have a closing tag.
      <br>
      <br> Let's say you wanted to put a line break into your webpage's text, then you would use the break tag &lt br &gt. This tag is also a void tag. Hence, using multiple &lt br &gt after a particular piece of text will lead to multiple line breaks.

      <h5><b> Paragraph Tag </b></h5> As discussed before, the "br" tag creates line breaks. It is considered an "inline" element. Inline elements are usually for modifying short lines of code. In contrast, the paragraph tag denoted by "p" creates an invisible boundary arond the code
      that you're working on. This kind of element is considered a "block" element. Block elements are used for groups of code or text.

      <h5><b> Span (Inline) vs Div (Block)</b></h5> These tags do not do anything specifically like say the bold tag. However, they allow a specific piece of information to be modified by CSS code. Similar to "br" tag, the "span" tag is inline. Hence, it's used for small chunks of code. Just like
      "paragraph" tag that created an invisible border around the code or text, you can use the "div" tag to do the same. Div is a block element used for large chunks of html code.
